; History and technical notes concerning BitBLT.
; Created: In Windows' distant past (c. 1983)

The following notes and thoughts were compiled during and after the
creation of different versions of BITBLT for Windows. The first
version of BITBLT was all static code, and supported sixteen combining
functions (raster operations, or ROPs).

The second version of BITBLT compiled a BLT operation to the stack in
an attempt to optimize larger BLTs, and supported the same sixteen ROPs.

The third version of BITBLT (called SUPERBLT at the time) supported all
possible terinary ROPs of AND (a), OR (o), XOR (x), and NOT (n), between
a source (S), a pattern (P), and the destination (D).  An encoding was
developed wherein the ROP could be specified as a sixteen bit number.

The fourth version of BITBLT involved color devices, and specified how
to convert color between monochrome (black/white) bitmaps and color
bitmaps (and a color display). Any reference to color conversion in
the notes only applies to color devices; There currently is no color
conversion for strictly black and white devices.  Color devices were
required to support bitmaps in both their color format and monochrome
(black/white) bitmaps.

The fifth version of BITBLT supports bitmaps which are greater than 64K
(an obvious problem in a iAPX80nnn environment).

BITBLT is similar to a byte block move operation except that blocks are
moved on bit boundaries.  This may require that the bits of the source
be aligned to the bits of the destination (phased aligned).  An example
of this would be moving all bits of a bitmap left two pixels.  Once the
bits are aligned, they are then combined with an optional pattern and
the destination as specified by the ROP.

The innermost functionality of BITBLT might be pictured as:

 * color conversion only applies if going between a black/white
   surface and a color surface (bitmap or display).


Bytes are fetched from a source.  Color conversion is applied if the source
and destination are of different color formats (color conversion will be
explained later).  The source bits are then aligned with the destination.
Bits from a previous phase alignment and this one are combined to form
one byte's worth of data.  The unused bits from the phase alignment are
saved for the next phase alignment (used/unused bits and phase alignment
is discussed in detail later). The ROP is applied against the source
bits, the pattern, and the destination as needed, and this result replaces
the destination byte.

In the following pictures, "S" is the source, "D" is the destination, and
"x" is the corner where the first byte will be fetched from.  The comment
on the right tells in which directions (X and Y) the BLT must be performed
to prevent overwritting a source byte before it is used as a source.  The
cases of overlap are:

    a)           Disjoint   (not special cased)

    b)           identical  (not special cased)

    c)           overlapping:

The following notes are more on the phase relationship of the source
and destination bitmaps.  Since BLTs are performed on bit boundaries
instead of byte boundaries, rotations of the source bitmap bytes may
have to be performed.   The source data is always rotated to be
aligned with the destination.  The notes will hopefully give some idea
on how the phase relationship is determined and how to start the BLT
off (some phase relationships require a different number of initial
source bitmap fetches to get enough bits to satisfy the first store).

The number of bytes seperating the source and destination in the
following examples is irrelevant; Only the relationship of the
bits within the bytes is of importance.

In the following, the saved and the used masks are applied after
rotating the source byte.   Used bits are those bits that are used
immediately.  Unused bits are those bits that have to be carried
over to the next byte (old unused bits are those unused bits from
the previous byte).

    In the following:

        saved bits mask     A mask which gives the bits that
                            must be carried over to the next
                            byte BLTed.

        used  bits mask     A mask which gives the bits that
                            are to be used for the current
                            byte BLTed.

        old unused bits     Those bits that were not used in
                            the last byte BLTed, and therefore
                            must be used for the current byte
                            BLTed.

        first byte mask     A mask which is used to mask the
                            bits of the very first byte BLTed
                            that are to be altered.  The
                            complement of this mask gives the
                            bits of the destination byte that
                            are to remain unaltered.

How the BLT is started is based on the cases of overlap as specified above.

For box cases 3,4,5,6,8,disjoint,same (as pictured above), BLT starting at
the left, stepping right.  Calculations are performed based on the left side
of the source and destination rectangles.  The starting mask is based on the
leftmost byte of the destination and the ending mask based on the rightmost
byte of the destination:

    Scan line case 1: (source start MOD 8) = (dest start MOD 8)

            |         3   4   5   6   7 | 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7 |

    first byte mask:

    | 0   0   0   1   1   1   1   1 |          (no ror's)
    |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|

    The first byte must be fetched.  Since both the source and the
    destination are on the same bit boundary, no phase alignment code
    is nessacary, and will not be generated.

    Scan line case 2: (source start MOD 8) > (dest start MOD 8)

    first byte mask:

    |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|


    To start the BLT, the first byte will be fetched and rotated.
    The used/unused bits will be masked and the unused bits saved
    (in this case the initial unused bits will be x4567).

    Since there will not be enough bits to complete the destination
    byte (3 bits short), another fetch and alignment will be performed.
    The old unused bits will be added to the new used bits (012), and
    displayed with a mask so the first 'n' bits won't be altered.  The
    new unused bits will be carried through to the next operation.

    Scan line case 3:  (source start MOD 8) < (dest start MOD 8)

    |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|

    To start the BLT, the first byte will be fetched and rotated.
    The unused bits will be saved (in this case the initial
    unused bits will be 67).  The new used bits (xxx345) will be
    displayed with a mask so the first 'n' bits won't be altered.
    The new unused bits will be carried through to the next operation.
    This is the same case as having a phase of 0, so they can use
    the same initial byte procedure.

    A useful piece of information derived from phase is how many
    bits to use and how many to save.  You use the rightmost "phase"
    number of bits, and save the leftmost 8-phase bits in the current
    operation.

For box cases 1,2,7, BLT starting at right, stepping left.  Calculations are
performed on the right side of the source and destination rectangles.  The
starting mask is based on the rightmost byte of the destination and the ending
mask based on the leftmost byte of the destination.

                        |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|


    The first byte must be fetched.  Since both the source and the

    is nessacary, and will not be generated.

    To start the BLT, the first byte will be fetched and rotated.
    The used/unused bits will be masked and the unused bits saved

    Since there will not be enough bits to complete the destination

    saved bits mask:                    used bits mask:

    | 0   0   0   0   0   0   1   1 |   | 1   1   1   1   1   1   0   0 |

                        first byte mask:
    phase is 2 (2 rol's)
           (6 ror's)    | 1   1   1   0   0   0   0   0 |
                        |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|


    To start the BLT, the first byte will be fetched and rotated.
    The unused bits will be saved (in this case the initial
    unused bits will be 01).  The new used bits (234xxx) will be
    displayed with a mask so the first 'n' bits won't be altered.
    The new unused bits will be carried through to the next operation.
    This is the same case as having a phase of 0, so they can use
    the same initial byte procedure.

    A useful piece of information derived from phase is how many
    bits to use and how many to save.  You save the rightmost phase
    number of bits, and use the leftmost phase bits in the current
    operation.

Interlace on the CGA: Some effort was involved to create an algorithm
for handling interleaved and non-interleaved BLTing.  Two increments
are required when interleave is involved, one for stepping from an odd
scan to an even scan, and one for stepping from an even scan to an odd
scan.  Once the two increments are determined, by XORing them together
you get an XOR mask which can be used to toggle between the two increments.

The Y update logic then consists of adding in the increment, then
XORing the increment with the XOR mask.

                    Starting     initial
           Y          raster     increment

       increasing      even      2000
       increasing      odd       E050

          2000 XOR E050 = C050 = increment XOR mask

       decreasing      even      1FB0
       decreasing      odd       E000

          1FB0 XOR E000 = FFB0 = increment XOR mask


Raster Operation Codes And Definitions

The raster operation codes define how GDI combines the bits in a source
bitmap with the bits in the destination bitmap.

Each raster operation code represents a Boolean operation in which the
source, the currently selected brush, and the destination are combined.

The operands used in the operations are:

    S   Source bitmap
    P   Currently selected brush (also called pattern)
    D   Destination bitmap

The Boolean operators used in these operations are:

    o   Bitwise Or
    x   Bitwise Exclusive Or
    a   Bitwise And
    n   Bitwise Not (inverse)

All Boolean operations are presented in reverse Polish notation.  For
example, the operation

    PSo

replaces the destination with a combination of the source and brush.
The operation

    DPSoo

combines the source and brush with the destination.  Note that there
are alternate spellings of the same function so although a particular
spelling may not be in the list, an equivalent form will be.

Each raster operation code is a 32-bit integer value whose high-order
word is a Boolean operation index and low-order word is the operation
code.  The 16-bit operation index is a zero-extended 8-bit value which
represents the result of the Boolean operation on predefined brush,
source, and destination values.  For example, the operation indexes for
the "PSo" and "DPSoo" operations are:



    P  S  D  |    PSo     DPSoo
    _________|   ______   _____
             |
    0  0  0  |      0       0
    0  0  1  |      0       1
    0  1  0  |      1       1
    0  1  1  |      1       1
    1  0  0  |      1       1
    1  0  1  |      1       1
    1  1  0  |      1       1
    1  1  1  |      1       1

 Operation index:  00FC    00FE


In this case, "PSo" has the operation index 00FC (read from bottom up);
"DPSoo" has the index 00FE.  These values define the location of the
corresponding raster operation code in the following table.  The "PSo"
operation is in line 252 (FC hex) of the table; "DPSoo" in line 254
(hex FE).

This section lists the raster operation codes.

How the ROP is encoded.

As this section is being written, it is now over two years since the
encoding scheme for the ROPs was developed and implemented.

As stated above, the high order word is the result of the raster
operation when using the given definitions of D, S, and P.  This
high order word was actually added at a later date for hardware
BLTers so at the most only a table lookup would be needed.  It can
also be used in place of the ROP parsing.

The low order word in and of itself doesn't contain enough information
to generate the ROP code.  What it contains is:

    a)  An index specifing which predefined parse sting to use.  A parse
    string has a format like:

        SDPSDPSD

          or

        S+SD-PDS

    where S, D, and P represent source, destination, and pattern.
    The "+" represents a "push", and the "-" represents a "pop".
    Sixteen of the 256 ROPs cannot be represented without using
    "push" and "pop".

    b)  Amount to rotate the parse string.  If the base string is:

        SDPSDPSD

    and an offset of 2 was given, the new base string would be:

        PSDPSDSD

    c)  Five logic operations.  The logic operations could be any of:

        NOT
        XOR
        OR
        AND

    d)  A parity bit used to imply a sixth logic operation of NOT.
    Pairs of trailing NOTs are discarded since they cancel.

Example 1: 85, 0085 1E05, PDSPnoaxn, D = not ((((not P) or S) and D) xor P)

    1E05 = 00 01 11 10 00 0 001 01
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |___ bias start by 1
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |______ use string 1
           |  |  |  |  |  |_________ parity - no trailing NOT
           |  |  |  |  |____________ Logic operation #1 is a NOT
           |  |  |  |_______________ Logic operation #2 is a OR
           |  |  |__________________ Logic operation #3 is a AND
           |  |_____________________ Logic operation #4 is a XOR
           |________________________ Logic operation #5 is a NOT

    String #1 is defined as:      SPDSPDSP

    After the bias, it will be:   PDSPDSPS

    The number of binary logic operations + 1 gives an index into the
    new string of the first operand.  In this case, there are three
    binary operations, so the first operand would be the fourth element
    of the string (P), the second operand would be the third element (S),
    and so forth.

Example 2: 71, 0071 1D5C, SSDxPDxaxn, D = not (((D xor P) and (D xor S)) xor S)

    1D5C = 00 01 11 01 01 0 111 00
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |___ don't bias start
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |______ use string 7
           |  |  |  |  |  |_________ parity - no trailing NOT
           |  |  |  |  |____________ Logic operation #1 is a XOR
           |  |  |  |_______________ Logic operation #2 is a XOR
           |  |  |__________________ Logic operation #3 is a AND
           |  |_____________________ Logic operation #4 is a XOR
           |________________________ Logic operation #5 is a NOT

    String #7 is defined as:      S+SD-PDS

    The number of binary logic operations + 1 normally gives an index
    into the string of the first operand.  When a push/pop is involved,
    this must be biased by 2 to account for the encoded push/pop.

    In this case, there are four binary operations, plus a push and
    a pop, so the first operand would be the seventh element of the
    string (D), the second operand would be the sixth element (P),
    and so forth.

Color conversion applies when the source and destination color formats
are different.  Color conversion could also effect the brush in use for
the BLT operation.

    a)  Mono ==> Color Color Conversion

    The mono ==> color color conversion is applied when the source
    is monochrome and the destination is color.

    When going from mono to color, 1 bits are considered to be
    background color, and 0 bits are considered to be foreground
    color.

    If the background color is white and the foreground (text) color
    is black, then the conversion needn't be generated (it just gives
    the source).

    b)  Color ==> Mono Color Conversion

    The color ==> mono color conversion is applied when the source
    is color and the destination is monochrome.

    When going from color to monochrome, all colors that are background
    should be mapped to 1's (white), and all colors which aren't back-
    ground to 0's (black).

    This also applies to brushes.  When going color ==> monochrome,
    the bits of the brush are also converted.  All brush pixels which
    match the background color should be mapped to 1's (white), and
    all colors which aren't background should be mapped to 0's (black).

SUPERBLT is a variation of OEMBITBL.ASM that compiles a BLT procedure
on the stack and executes it.  The code is placed on the stack and all
intermediate values are stored on the stack.


SUPERBLT takes advantage of the fact that a BLT operation can be defined
in terms of specific operations, those being:

    initial fetch(es)
    initial byte processing
    innerloop
    last byte fetch
    last byte processesing
    loop control

The innerloop and last byte routines may or may not be present, depending
on the size of the BLT.  If they are not needed, then there will not be
any code generated for them.

The phase alignment is one place where SUPERBLT gains much speed over
OEMBITBL.  Instead of generating a  "ROL AL,CL" instruction, a series
of "ROR AL,1" or "ROL AL,1" instructions are generated which will be
the optimum time for rotating the bits for alignment (this method gains
up to 20 clocks over rotating through CL).  Also, if the phase alignment
happens to be zero (no rotates needed), no phase alignment code will be
generated at all.


An example "PSx" BLT follows.  The phase relationship will be 2 in the
example.  There will be 33 bytes to be processed in the innerloop, and
there will be a last byte to be processed.  The source bitmap is in memory,
and the destination is an interlaced screen.  There will be two required
fetches to start the BLT.

BLT:
    push    cx                  ;Save source and destination pointers
    push    di
    push    si

;   This is what the compiled pattern fetch code should look like:

getPat:
    mov dx,ds                   ;Save source segment
    mov cx,si                   ;  and offset
    mov si,pattern offset       ;Set pattern offset address
    mov ax,pattern segment      ;Set pattern segment address
    mov bl,row index
    mov ds,ax
    and bx,7                    ;Make into an index
    mov bl,[bx][si]             ;Get the pattern for this scan line
    mov si,cx                   ;Restore source offset

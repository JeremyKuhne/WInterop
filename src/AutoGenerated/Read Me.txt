This project exists purely to get autogenerated files. There isn't a good way to run auto generated tasks from shared projects currently.
Rather than put them in a consumer, creating a dummy project and including the relevant files in the Common project so that they show up
in the consuming projects.

Unfortunately you need to manually run "Build:Transform All Templates" to regenerate. I'll likely write some simple template parser to deal
with the lack of support for T4 templating in VS. Including the targets doesn't work right with SDK style projects and the build tasks are
not officially published as a nuget package.
